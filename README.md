# HyperStack - Full Stack Game

## Introduction

HyperStack is a fun and addictive arcade-style game where players must carefully stack moving blocks to build the tallest tower possible. The goal is to align each block precisely on top of the previous one, and any misalignment results in the block getting cut, making it harder to continue stacking. The game ends when the player can no longer place a new block on the shrinking platform.
